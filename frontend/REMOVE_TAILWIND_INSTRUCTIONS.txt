# Remove Tailwind from Project

1. Delete the following files if they exist:
   - tailwind.config.js
   - postcss.config.cjs (if it only contains Tailwind config)

2. Remove all Tailwind-related dependencies from package.json and package-lock.json:
   - tailwindcss
   - @tailwindcss/postcss
   - @tailwindcss/oxide
   - @tailwindcss/node

3. Run the following commands in your frontend directory:
   npm uninstall tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss @tailwindcss/oxide @tailwindcss/node
   npm install

4. Delete any Tailwind classes from your React components and CSS files (already done).

5. If you see any errors about missing Tailwind, clear node_modules and reinstall:
   rm -rf node_modules
   npm install

6. Done! Tailwind is fully removed from your project.
